# Landing Page [![Tweet](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/http/shields.io.svg?style=social&logo=twitter)](https://twitter.com/romaestradaflo)

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue.svg)  ![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.0

This web application works with Angular 10, it's a landing page and the scss syntax that I use is (BEM) to have a good structure and herarchy on the styles.

Special thanks go to:
- [Romario Estrada](http://www.romaef.com) for his nice develop.

## DEMO

You can see the demo working on the next link [landingWThompson](https://landingWThompson.web.app/) and if you liked, give me a star on the [Respossitory](https://github.com/RomarioAugustoEstradaFlorez/testWThompson) 

## Quick start

Clone the repo: 

`git clone https://github.com/RomarioAugustoEstradaFlorez/testWThompson`

Stay on the root of the project and in this case execute `cd testWThompson/`

To install the dependencies:
- `npm install --production`

or if you want to install the dev dependencies too, use only:
- `npm install`

To start the client in local:
- `npm start` or `ng serve` 

The client in Angular will run at `port 4200` and the url to access is `http://localhost:4200`.



### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
